# Mission 5 – Phase 2 - Z Energy Station Locator

This project is a full-stack redesign of the Z Energy station locator and fuel price experience, built using React (Vite), Node/Express, MongoDB, and Docker as part of Mission 5 – Phase 2. Using the Figma prototype created by UX Designers in Phase 1, we implemented a mobile-first application that improves station filtering, visibility of fuel prices, and overall usability for customers like Alex, the target persona. Each developer contributed a complete screen with frontend and backend functionality, beginning with a Proof of Concept to validate the stack before building a final version that closely matches the prototype. The team collaborated through GitHub, shared common components, and containerised the application for consistent development across environments.

### Each developer contributed to multiple screens, including:

- Implementing UI layouts based on the prototype
- Connecting to a Node/Express backend
- Persisting data using MongoDB
- Reproducing UI interactions and mobile behaviour
- Collaborating via GitHub
- Containerising the project with Docker

## More Details

The project combined frontend, backend, and UX implementation to deliver a cohesive, mobile-first redesign of the Z Energy station locator experience. As a team, we developed responsive screens based on the Figma prototype, implemented user flows, and created reusable UI components that matched the brand’s visual style. The backend was built with Node.js and Express, connecting to a MongoDB database to handle API requests and data persistence. Docker was used to containerise both the frontend and backend for consistent development environments. Collaboration was a major focus, with team members working through GitHub branches, shared component discussions, and coordinated merges to ensure a unified codebase. Together, the team produced a functional and visually accurate version of the redesigned application, demonstrating full-stack development practices and a user-centred approach grounded in UX insights.
